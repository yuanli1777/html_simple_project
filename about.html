        <h2>About Nintendo ðŸŽƒ</h2><br><br>

        <h3>Nintendo Founder</h3>
        <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*JRWUZR0xmt_h0KagKOCOQw.jpeg" width="400" alt="">
        <p>Hiroshi Yamauchi (å±±å†…æº¥, Yamauchi Hiroshi, 7 November 1927 â€“ 19 September 2013) was a Japanese businessman and
            the third president of Nintendo, joining the company on 25 April 1949 until stepping down on 24 May 2002,
            being subsequently succeeded by Satoru Iwata. During his 53-year tenure, Yamauchi transformed Nintendo from
            a hanafuda card-making company that had been active solely in Japan into a multibillion-dollar video game
            publisher and global conglomerate. He was the great-grandson of Fusajiro Yamauchi, Nintendo's first
            president and founder. Hiroshi Yamauchi owned the Seattle Mariners baseball team from 1992 until his death.

        <p>Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata has passed away at the age of 55. In a statement from the Nintendo Company, the
            cause of death was due to a bile duct growth.

            Iwata began his journey at Nintendo in the 1980s and worked on games like EarthBound. During his tenure he
            oversaw the launches of the GameCube, DS, Wii & Wii U systems. In 2000 he became a Director and in 2002 was
            appointed as the fourth president (succeeding Hiroshi Yamuchi).

            Iwata was a fixture in the gaming industry and known for being one of the nicest executives around. He will
            be immensely missed.</p>
